**Abstract:**<br> PDF File Upload and HTML Extraction Project.<br>
This project involves building a system that allows users to upload PDF files and automatically extracts the content from the uploaded PDFs, converting them into HTML format. The solution will be developed using Django as the backend framework for file handling and management, along with a PDF parsing library such as PyPDF2 or pdfminer for extracting text and other elements from the PDF. Once the content is extracted, it will be converted into well-structured HTML and stored for further usage or display.

**Key features of the project include:**
**PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files via a web interface..<br>
**PDF Content Extraction:** The system extracts text, images, and other elements from the uploaded PDFs..<br>
**HTML Conversion:** Extracted content is converted into valid, structured HTML format..<br>
**Storage:** The original PDF and the generated HTML are stored for future access..<br>
**User Interface:** A simple interface to allow users to upload, manage, and view the extracted content..<br>
This project streamlines the process of converting PDF documents into web-ready formats, improving accessibility and usability for web-based applications.
